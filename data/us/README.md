# US data

US datasets are (usually) encoded with a column named "FIPS" denoting the county code. Translations to county names are in `processing_data/fips_key.csv`.

## Getting started

For the most curated dataset of COVID-19 cases, see `covid/nyt_us_counties.csv`. Additional variables can be merged in from the appropriate subdirectories, but we also provide useful aggregate datasets of relevant variables (demographics, health, etc.) in `aggregate_berkeley.csv` and `aggregate_jhu.csv`.

Summary:
* `aggregate_berkeley.csv`: Demographic, health, and other information compiled by Bin Yu's group at UC Berkeley. A few columns are selected from a few thousand by feature selection done by Berkeley. The full dataset includes data on number of icu beds and hospitals per county prevalance of chronic diseases, number of total deaths (from any cause), mortality rate from respiratory diseases, voting history, and impact from smoking at the county level. You can download full dataset: `df_county_level_cached.csv` file at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EHqZxbTVPO5RDxDvJntZMNBjhxGeE2bU. You can regenerate the full dataset and view the original sources at https://github.com/Yu-Group/covid-19-ventilator-demand-prediction.
* `aggregate_jhu.csv`: Demographic, health, and other information compiled by Johns Hopkins University. https://github.com/JieYingWu/COVID-19_US_County-level_Summaries

## `mobility`

Anonymized mobility metrics to analyze efficacy of social distancing, from Descartes Labs: https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19.

The data is available in CSV format with each date as a row in the
[DL-us-mobility-daterow.csv](DL-us-mobility-daterow.csv) file.

```csv
date,country_code,admin_level,admin1,admin2,fips,samples,m50,m50_index
2020-03-26,US,2,"New Mexico","Santa Fe County","35049",1331,0.095,1
...
```

An alternate arrangement of the same data in CSV format with dates in
the header, which may be preferable for some users, is in the
[DL-us-m50.csv](DL-us-m50.csv),
[DL-us-m50_index.csv](DL-us-m50_index.csv) and
[DL-us-samples.csv](DL-us-samples.csv) files.

```csv
country_code,admin_level,admin1,admin2,fips,2020-03-24,2020-03-25,2020-03-26
