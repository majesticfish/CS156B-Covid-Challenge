# Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports
See https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/

The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as **retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential**.

EDIT: Google is now providing a full daily refreshing CSV file detailing
the mobility differences for as many nations, states, and cities as possible.
The old extraction code from PDF files has been deprecated. 
The `mobility_report_US.csv` and `extrapolated_mobility_report_US.csv` files have also been deprecated, as to avoid confusion.
Please refer to the `Global_Mobility_Report.csv` file for further use of the Google Mobility Data.

Rip to my PDF extraction code :(((
